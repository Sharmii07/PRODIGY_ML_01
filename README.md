# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains a simple implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model is trained and evaluated using separate datasets for training and testing.

## Project Structure

- `your_train_data.csv`: Training dataset file.
- `your_test_data.csv`: Testing dataset file.
- `house_price_prediction.py`: Main script to train and evaluate the linear regression model.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
